<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
With the abundance of listicles and helpful articles recommending things to do in Singapore, especially in recent times where the focus is on “Singapolidays”, many people might be overwhelmed by the availability of choices, and can’t decide on what to do -- the paradox of choice. Sometimes, all they need is someone (or something) to decide for them.

<b>Problem Solution</b><br>
To create an application which takes in a few user’s preferences and provides only 3 activities to choose from. It’s much like a lucky draw box, only smarter and more tailored.

<b>User Stories</b><br>
- As a user, I want an app that provides suggestions on what my friends and I can do/see/experience, taking into consideration each of our likes and dislikes<br>
- As a user, I want an app that allows me to discover new places/activities to explore<br>
- As a user, I want an app that takes away the mental load of deciding what to do as there are just so many things I want/can do around Singapore (thereby eliminating the paradox of choice)<br>
- As a user, I want an app where I can easily find something to do without doing much research<br>
