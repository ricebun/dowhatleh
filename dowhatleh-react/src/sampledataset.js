                "description": "Nestled within VivoCity, Barossa is best described as an Australian-inspired bar and restaurant where \"outback meets chic\". If you're looking to enjoy hearty Australian fare at a place that's rustic, laid-back and unpretentious, then head on over after a hard day's work and indulge in premium grades of Australian beef that's prepared with the freshest ingredients. MUST TRIES: Barossa is known for its winning trifecta of beef, burger and beers.  Signature dishes include the rib eye tasting platter that features premium rib eyes, blue cheese steak burger and Barossa kurobuta grain-fed pork rack.  Flowing gloriously from the beer taps are handcrafted lagers and ales from Archipelago Brewery.",
